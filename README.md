# Unit-4-Game

Crystal Collector Game
This is a simple button-click game for the purpose of practicing jQuery.  The goal is to click on the four crystals to match the Goal Number that randomly generates at the beginning of the game.  Matching the number wins the game; exceeding it loses the game.

# Getting Started
